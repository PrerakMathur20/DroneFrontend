## Frame of the drone

The Drone has a Arducopter frame that keeps the Flight Controllers, brushless DC motors, and other electronic parts safe. This drone has a QAV 250mm frame, which has specific mounting points for each part and keeps them in place securely.

## Flight Controller

The flight controller tells the Electronic Speed Controllers (ESCs) what speed it wants the motors to run at. The ESCs then turn this speed into a signal that the motors can understand. This flight controller tells the drone where to go.
It uses a radio transmitter and receiver  (Flysky/Avionic). It also uses wireless audio and video Tx/RX set for live video capturing.

The APM 2.6 flight controller   module has a jumper that lets you use either the built-in compass or an external compass. The APM 2.8 is perfect for use with multi-copters and rovers because of this.

## Voltage

The voltage of your battery affects how fast your motors go. Higher voltage batteries are capable of turning motors faster as compare to lower-voltage batteries..
It can be controlled from Mission Planneror from android App which needs   Mission planner software for APM configuration.

The type of ESCs and motors you can use will depend on how much power your battery should have. When the motor and ESC are put together, they will show what voltage is needed for proper operation or RPM. This drone has a 40 A current flow ESCs and a 2200 MAH battery.

## Motors

We have also used the A2212 1000 KV BLDC Brushless DC Motor, which is a brushless motor made for quadcopters and multirotors. It is a motor with 1000kV. It has great performance, a lot of power, and great efficiency. These motors are great for quadcopters with propellers that are 8 to 10 inches long. Use this to make quadcopters that are efficient and work well.

## Ready to go

Once you got everything to work download the app and now able to enjoy the functions like Follow me mode and waypoint navigation features.
