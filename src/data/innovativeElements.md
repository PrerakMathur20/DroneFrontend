The innovative elements can be categorised in following four sub-categories:

## Open-Source Hardware

All Android smartphones will be able to use the same hardware (of brand or version). This interface allows the gadget to talk to the phone's internals. The suggested hardware would appropriate the phone's resources, including its CPU, memory, graphics processing unit (GPU), camera, and cellular radio frequency (RF).

## Drone Technology

Drones will be utilized to map the landscape and capture high-quality images and video.

## Affordable Technology

Compared to other commercially available drones, this one is more budget-friendly because it uses recycled iPhones. Since the suggested hardware has an autonomous flight aid mode, a separate remote control is unnecessary. And the smartphone is not (in essence) a component of the hardware that will be shipped to the customer. The proposed hardware can be accessed by the end user through an Android app, lowering the price of the final device even further.

## Recycling e-waste

The proposed hardware relies heavily on components taken from a broken smartphone. By finding new uses for old electronics, it contributes to the spread of eco-friendly technologies.
