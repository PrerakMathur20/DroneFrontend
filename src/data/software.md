## Frontend Application

The website's front end was developed using the expo edition of react native.

In addition, flutter is employed in the context of online video streaming.

## Image Processing

OpenCV is a software library used for various computer vision and image processing tasks. It's a free library that can be used for a wide variety of purposes, including recognition of faces, tracking of objections, and identification of landmarks. The application is able to incorporate data automation, model tracking, performance monitoring, and model retraining using _TensorFlow_.

## Sensor Data

Machine vibration monitoring makes use of sensors like a proximity sensor that are linked to the app in order to collect data on the amount of angular separation between a shaft and a bearing.

Any body or object's acceleration can be calculated by using an accelerometer sensor in relation to its instantaneous rest frame. The gyroscope, camera, network sensor, and storage sensor features are all put to use.

- With the use and integration of all these platforms and technologies we are able to build the app to manage all the requirements of drone.
